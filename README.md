# arduino-quad

I want to thank Jeff Rowberg, who created the library i2cdevlib that I used for extracting the yaw, pitch and roll values from the dmp in the MPU-6050 breakout board. I also want to thank Luis RÃ³denas for writing the sketch based on Jeff Rowbergs library I used to calibrate and retrive the offset values for my MPU-6050.
